            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <h2>Description of target Audience</h2>
            <p>This website is  planned to be used by people age 16-40. The range is 
                because its for people who will be planning to do things in the local 
                area and need to know about the events and how the weather will be.
                this can be any event that the local area will be hosting so it will
                be appealing to young adults, as well as parents. This site is for people who
                are going to be doing anything in the local area. This is because it displays
                the weather which is important when doing any outdoors activity, and then it
                also includes whats happeniong in the area for people who dont already have 
                something to do in mind. the income can range from low to high as community 
                hosted events will likely be cheap or no cost, but if something more formal, like a 
                concert, were to be hosted it would require a fee that would vary depending on who was 
                performing. 
            </p>
            <h2>Persona 1</h2>
            <p>Claire is a mother with 2 elementary school aged chikldren.
                Claire is always on the run and trying to keep up with everything
                thats going on around her. She's always trying to plan activities
                for her kids while weaving in all of the other aspects of life. 
                She tries to keep up to date with her friends and chat with them 
                ,but sometimes she falls behind and ends up learning about current 
                events from them after they've already passed. Claire would be interested
                in a website like this so that she can always stay on her feet with knowing
                the weather for her local area when she's planning things for her kids.
                That way she knows when she can take them to the park, or if they need to 
                find games to play at home instead. She also would love that our site has 
                the current events for her area. She wants to be in the loop and in 
                the know. This way she can keep up even with all of her other
                tasks that she works on all day, and still be able to know what
                recent events her friends are talking about. 
            </p>
            <h2>Persona 2</h2>
            <p>John is always driving around for work. He never goes too far
                away from home, but he hits many of the local towns. His job has
                him outside frequently and he is always running around while hes 
                in town. John would be interested in our website so that he can get a 
                quick view of how the weather will be so he can know if he should leave 
                early because of bad weather. He also needs to know this so that he 
                can dress to stay warm enough in the cold, but also so he can be busy 
                in the heat without being too hot.
